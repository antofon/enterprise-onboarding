# Build log

Chronological engineering decisions. Each entry: problem, decision, why, alternatives, result.

## 2026-09-28, Day 1

### Repo layout: one python package

- **Problem:** the suggested layout had code in `app/`, `target_platform/`, `scripts/`, `ui/`. Three importable top-level packages complicates packaging and the Docker image.
- **Decision:** all importable code lives in `app/`. `target_platform/` holds the fictional platform's schema exports and documentation, not code. `scripts/` and `ui/` are thin entry points.
- **Why:** one package, one `pyproject`, one `uv sync`, one import root in tests.
- **Alternatives:** a `src/` layout with multiple packages. More ceremony than a one-week build needs.
- **Result:** `uv sync` and the Docker build are a single step.

### Postgres from compose on port 5433, not 5432

- **Problem:** development machines often already run a PostgreSQL on 5432 (this one does).
- **Decision:** compose publishes the database on 127.0.0.1:5433 for local tools; inside the compose network the API uses `db:5432`.
- **Why:** `docker compose up` must work on a reviewer's laptop without them stopping their own database.
- **Result:** no port collision, and the database is not exposed beyond localhost.

### Ports bound to localhost only

- **Problem:** compose files usually publish `8000:8000`, which on a server with a public address exposes the API and UI to the internet.
- **Decision:** every published port is `127.0.0.1:<port>`. `http://localhost:8000` still works on a laptop; nothing listens on the public interface.
- **Why:** the tool handles customer data in real life; the default should not need a firewall to be safe.

### Two schemas in one database

- **Problem:** the fictional target platform needs its own tables, and the migration must not be able to bypass its API.
- **Decision:** `onboarding` and `target` schemas in the same PostgreSQL. The target schema is only written through the `/target/v1` API.
- **Why:** one database keeps the reviewer setup simple while the separation keeps the migration honest.
- **Alternatives:** a second database container. More moving parts for no additional signal.

### `create_all` now, alembic later

- **Problem:** the schema will change daily for a week.
- **Decision:** tables are created from the SQLAlchemy metadata at startup. Alembic migrations come once the model stops moving (Day 6 cleanup at the earliest).
- **Why:** migration files for a schema that changes every day would be noise; schema versioning is documented as a production consideration.

### Mock target platform lives in the same FastAPI process

- **Problem:** the migration layer must go through a realistic REST interface, and reviewers want one command.
- **Decision:** the target platform is a separate router (`/target/v1`) with its own tables, and the migration runner calls it over HTTP through `TARGET_API_BASE_URL`.
- **Why:** the network seam is real (serialization, status codes, timeouts, retries all apply) without a second service to run.
- **Alternatives:** a dedicated container. Easy to split later since the base URL is configuration.

### Plain python orchestration first

- **Problem:** the workflow has state, branching, and a human review step; LangGraph is a candidate.
- **Decision:** stage functions in plain Python with the project's stage stored in PostgreSQL. LangGraph is evaluated on Day 6 against the working workflow, and the outcome is recorded here either way.
- **Why:** the prompt's own rule: do not overengineer around the framework before the domain workflow exists.

### uv for dependencies

- **Decision:** `uv` with `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock`, also inside the Docker build.
- **Why:** fast, reproducible, and the `pyproject.toml` is standard so pip or poetry users can still install.

### structlog for logging

- **Decision:** structlog with JSON output in containers, console output locally, request id bound per request, stage context bound per pipeline step.
- **Why:** the logs must let someone diagnose an onboarding failure by project id and run id without grepping free text.
